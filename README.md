### üß© Project Steps

1. Data Ingestion

- Created /bronze/ folder in ADLS Gen2 and uploaded raw CSV files.
- Set up Synapse pipelines to ingest data into the Bronze layer. 
- Connected Azure SQL Database using Azure Key Vault for secure credentials.

2. Data Transformation (Bronze ‚ûî Silver Layer)
   
- Built dataflows in Synapse to clean and standardize data.
- Applied filters, aggregation (to remove duplicates), and alter row transformations.
- Loaded cleaned data into staging tables (Silver layer) in Azure SQL Database.

3. Data Modeling (Silver ‚ûî Gold Layer)

Created 4 analytical views:

- View_1_InStoreAverageOrderValue
- View_1_OTAverageOrderValue
- View_2_CustomerSegmentation
- View_3_PeakTimes
- View_4_AgentPerformance

These views provided clean, business-ready data models for analysis.

4. Reporting & Dashboarding

- Connected Power BI to Azure SQL Database (Import Mode).
- Published the final dashboard to Microsoft Fabric Workspace.
